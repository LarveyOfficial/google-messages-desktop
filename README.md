# Google Messages Desktop ![master status](https://github.com/LarveyOfficial/google-messages-desktop/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)

Run Google Messages as a desktop app, a la iMessage. For those of us that prefer not to have a browser tab always open for this sort of thing.

Forked from:
- [Android Messages™ Desktop](https://github.com/OrangeDrangon/android-messages-desktop)

**Important Note**
The only difference between this and the fork is simply the name of "Google Messages" and a different icon.
Code is not written by me, I am simply changing the icon/name, and that is all.
